                        <li class="mb-3"><strong>Custom Video Presentations</strong> — These combine live spokesperson footage with motion graphics, effects, and branding to create richer video content for product demos, corporate presentations, or tutorials.</li>
                        <li class="mb-3"><strong>Whiteboard and Animation Videos</strong> — For businesses that want a more visual or educational style, animated and whiteboard explainer videos are also available.</li>

    <!-- WHY SPOKESPERSON VIDEOS WORK -->

                    <h2 class="section-title">Why Spokesperson Videos Work</h2>
                    <p class="section-sub mb-4">The logic behind video spokespersons is grounded in human psychology: people respond strongly to faces and voices. Static text and images can only go so far in engaging someone's attention. But when a real person speaks directly to a visitor, it strengthens trust and motivates action — whether that's buying a product, signing up for a service, or requesting more information.</p>
                    <p class="section-sub mb-0">According to Website Talking Heads' own data, professional video spokespeople can increase conversions by up to 80% and keep users engaged three times longer compared with sites that lack dynamic video content.</p>

                    <p class="section-sub mb-0">One of the strengths of this service is customization. You can choose a spokesperson whose style matches your brand voice, customize scripts, and even select how the video displays on your site. The company manages the production from start to finish — from casting to scriptwriting to final delivery — so you get a finished product that aligns with your goals.</p>

                    <p class="section-sub mb-0">As attention spans shorten and competition for engagement grows, incorporating high-quality video — especially with a real human presence — can make a significant difference in how visitors perceive and interact with your business online. Website Talking Heads offers a strategic, professionally produced way to bring that human element into your digital presence.</p>
